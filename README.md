# Astro Demo w/ Wrangler Config

This demo shows you how to use a wrangler.toml file in an Astro project. This currently only works in local mode via `wrangler pages dev`, but will soon work for deployed sites as well.

Begin by running `npm run preview`. Go to `http://localhost:8787/api/hello` to see the environment variable from `wrangler.toml` returned.

To see how this is implemented, go to `pages/api/hello.ts`. The environment variable was also defined first in `env.d.ts`. 

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
